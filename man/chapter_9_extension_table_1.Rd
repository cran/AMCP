\usage{data("chapter_9_extension_table_1")}
\format{
  A data frame with 6 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{group}}{the group (treatment group vs wait-list control group)}
    \item{\code{x}}{the weight lost by the control group}
    \item{\code{y}}{the weight lost by the treatment group}
  }
}
\details{Table 9E.1 shows the data from Table 9.1 after some minor modifications to reflect some heterogeneity of regression. The data were altered in such a way that the means in both groups are the same as in the original example, as is the pooled within-group slope.}
