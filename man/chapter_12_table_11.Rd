\usage{data("chapter_12_table_11")}
\format{
  A data frame with 10 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{angle0}}{reaction time when noise is present minus reaction time when noise is absent at angle 0}
    \item{\code{angle4}}{reaction time when noise is present minus reaction time when noise is absent at angle 4}
    \item{\code{angle8}}{reaction time when noise is present minus reaction time when noise is absent at angle 8}
  }

\details{A third covariance matrix is relevant for the AB interaction because this effect does not average over either A or B. Instead, the interaction assesses whether the B difference is the same at each level of A. Table 12.11 presents scores that address this question. For each subject, a given score represents the noise effect (i.e., reaction time when noise is present minus reaction time when noise is absent) at a particular level of the angle factor.}
