    \item{\code{months30}}{McCarthy IQ score for 30-month-old}
    \item{\code{months36}}{McCarthy IQ score for 36-month-old}

\details{The first table in Chapter 15 presents the Hypothetical McCarthy data again (originally shown in Table 11.5). This data set is used throughout the chapter as the to illustrate the discussion given on the mixed model. At the time of this writing the mixed model procedure is SPSS is not as fully developed the SAS analog PROC MIXED. For this reason no analyses using SPSS are provided to replicate the analyses given in Chapter 15. For those interested, the procedure MIXED is the SPSS syntax analog of PROC MIXED in SAS. 

Notice that data have been obtained at four ages for 12 children. We will presume at least initially that the null hypothesis we wish to test is that the population mean McCarthy score is the same at all four ages.}
