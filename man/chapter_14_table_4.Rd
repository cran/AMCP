\details{For the hypothetical data contained in Table 14.1, a perceptual psychologist studying the visual system was interested in determining the extent to which interfering visual stimuli slow the ability to recognize letters. Participants are brought into a laboratory where they are seated in front of a tachistoscope. Variations in the presentations of letters is examined with interest being on the reaction time for target letters presented either in the center of the screen or off centered with and without "noise" accompanying the target letters.}
