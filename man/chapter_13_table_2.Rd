The data used in Chapter 13 Table 2.

\usage{data("chapter_13_table_2")}
\format{
  A data frame with 8 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{time1}}{participant score at time 1}
    \item{\code{time2}}{participant score at time 2}
    \item{\code{time3}}{participant score at time 3}
  }
}
\details{For the hypothetical data contained in Table 13.2, eight participants were measured at three occasions. The question of interest is: "Is there a population mean difference between across Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 measurement occasions?" Table 13.2 presents hypothetical data for a three-level design. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the population means of scores at all three time points are equal to each.}
