The data used in Chapter 6 for Table 1.
}
\usage{data("chapter_6_table_1")}
\format{
  A data frame with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Recall}}{the number of words recalled by the child after the study time expires}
    \item{\code{Minutes}}{the amount of time, in minutes, the child was permitted to study}
  }
}
\details{The data in Table 6.1 consist of recall scores for 24 children who have been randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions where there are 6 children in each condition. The experimental conditions of interest are 1, 2, 3, and 4 minutes where the number of minutes is the amount of time the child is allotted to study a list of words before attempting to recall the words. The dependent variable (i.e., the recall scores) are the number of words the child is able to recall after a brief interference task. 
 
The first hypothesis of interest is whether the number of words recalled is linearly related to the number of minutes spent studying. We first test this hypothesis by determining if the linear trend (/POLYNOMIAL = 1) is statistically significant. Pages 252 and 253 are associated with this test.
